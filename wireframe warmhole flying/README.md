# Flying Through a Wireframe Wormhole 🌌

This project takes my **Three.js learning journey** a step further by creating an animated **wormhole effect**.  
It uses a tube geometry with wireframes, post-processing bloom effects, and a moving camera to simulate flying through a glowing tunnel full of colorful details.

## ✨ Features  
- A **tube geometry** rendered as a **wireframe wormhole**  
- **Dynamic camera movement** along the spline path (gives the illusion of flying through)  
- **UnrealBloomPass** for glowing highlights and a more cinematic look  
- **Fog effect** to enhance depth and atmosphere  
- Randomly placed **wireframe cubes** floating inside the wormhole  
- Interactive **OrbitControls** for extra camera freedom  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – JavaScript 3D library  
- OrbitControls for interactivity  
- Post-processing with **EffectComposer**, **RenderPass**, and **UnrealBloomPass**

💡 Compared to my very first project (a rotating cube), this one feels like a **giant leap**.  
It combines geometry, animation, effects, and camera control to create an immersive visual experience—making it one of the most exciting milestones in my 3D journey so far.
