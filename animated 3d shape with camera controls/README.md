# First 3D Animated Shape with Three.js  

This project is my very first experiment with **Three.js**, where I created and animated a 3D shape in the browser. 🚀  

## 🌟 What I Built  
- A **3D Icosahedron** (20-sided shape) with both a solid surface and a wireframe overlay.  
- A smooth **rotation animation** along the **Y-axis**.  
- Interactive **camera controls** using OrbitControls (zoom and mouse movement).  
- A simple **lighting setup** using a Hemisphere Light.  
- Responsive rendering that adapts to the browser window size.  

## 🖼️ Preview  
Here are two static previews of the shape (note: the images do not show the animation):

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Setting up a basic **Three.js scene** (scene, camera, renderer).  
- Creating and customizing **geometry** and **materials**.  
- Adding **lights** to improve visibility.  
- Writing a simple **animation loop** with `requestAnimationFrame`.  
- Implementing **OrbitControls** for interactivity.

## 🚀 How to Run It (Using NPM)
To run this project using npm, you must have [Three.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) installed in your project folder:

1. Open a terminal in your project directory.
2. Install Three.js:
   ```bash
   npm install three
   ```
3. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.
4. The browser will open automatically and display the 3D animated shape.
